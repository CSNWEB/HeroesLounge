                <p>This league is meant for EU players. As such, we expect players to have their main account on the EU server and must be available at reasonable times to play their opponents and practice with their team <em>(all times displayed are CET/CEST)</em>. Past experience has shown most players from different regions encounter problems with hero pools, availability and ping when playing in EU.</p>

                <a href="https://discordapp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Discord</a> is a text and voice application that allows us to be able to communicate announcements and important information, as well as players to be able to chat with each other. It’s a fun, and informative place to go to discuss everything related to Heroes Lounge, as well as Heroes of the Storm. It's also extremely useful for getting in touch with your opponents. We recommend everyone be available on our <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/aePkBsZ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discord server</a> at least during their match.

                Each week you will have 1 match, played as a best of 3, to complete. You schedule the time with your opponent as to when can suit everyone best. There will be 10 rounds in total, and the top teams from each division will then qualify to play in the playoffs.

                Absolutely! We accept free agent registrations, meaning as soon as sign up closes you will be paired with other free agents to form a team, and start playing together immediately. You can also join an existing team or form a new one with other free agents before sign ups close.

                We encourage teams to keep up with the one match per week schedule, but sometimes it just doesn't work out. If your team finds itself unable to play one week, you can organize with your opponents to post-pone the game for one week, so you have two weeks in total to play any match. However, you still have to schedule the match within the first week, otherwise your team will go inactive. You may put in a placeholder date for that purpose.

Check out the #players_to_recruit channel on <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/aePkBsZ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discord</a> if there are free agents still looking for a team and put a message out in #team_recruiting that your team in looking to recruit a player.

                <p>In our efforts to balace between the needs of the teams, the lounge and the casters, we've decided to seperate the casters into 2 groups: Lounge casters and External casters.</p>
                <p>Lounge casters are casters who were vetted by our Head of Casters (Heartless) and are allowed to cast any team they wish without teams being able to decline them with the exception of their own team, which they are not allowed to cast.</p>
                <p>However, in the case of External casters, teams can decline the External caster.</p>
