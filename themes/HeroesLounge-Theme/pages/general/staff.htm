                <p>
                    27, Swiss/British. I am the founder of Heroes Lounge. I am also the owner of Barcraft Zurich, organising public viewings for esports events. Although professionally a data scientist, I have always been a huge fan of esports, particularly with Blizzard games, with my first love being for SC2. Building Heroes Lounge from the ground up has been an incredible experience, and I am proud to be part of such an awesome community.

                    33 year old IT professional from the UK, originally got involved in eSports with Jedi Academy way back in 2004. Now organises stuff for Heroes Lounge, which roughly translates to making sure everyone else gets their work done. Blogger, Caster, Mod plus a bunch of other stuff that I have no time to do. Kinda bummed out to discover TinyOwl was not in fact, a tiny owl.

                <p>
                    32, Israel (currently living in Bulgaria). I first got into eSports when StarCraft: Brood-War came out, which I got pretty competitive in and was part of a local group of players that arranged local tournaments (that was back in 1999).
                    First time I heard about Heroes Lounge was through a reddit post made by cosmic back in 2016 where he introduced Heroes Lounge to the world.
                    I immediately fell in love with the idea and wanted to help, more specifically as a caster and after talking to Cosmic a bit, I got accepted and started my journey in Heroes Lounge and now I am head of casters, whose main job is to make sure our beloved teams get cast.
                    It will never cease to amaze me what a group of volunteers can do with a little bit of time, and a lot passion!

                    I am 31 years old from Germany. I started with Heroes Lounge in the beginning in Season 1 as Free Agent. Around the same time i did some streaming on twitch and loved the idea to stream the Lounge matches. Therefore I started organizing the streams and the streamers and by doing so, got involved in the organisation of Heroes Lounge. My main responsibilities have been Casting, the Twitch Stream, the Youtube Channel and the VIP system I setup. Nowadays I had to take a step back due to other responsibilities.
