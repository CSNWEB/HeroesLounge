<p>The advent of season 4 brought many changes to Heroes Lounge. We've found higher quality teams <em>(with it, increase to boundary of division 1)</em>, more <a href="https://heroeslounge.gg/user/view/115" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">moderators</a> to hassle, a new website, <a href="https://heroeslounge.gg/user/view/46" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Froge</a> finding himself in division 1, and many new teams joining the fray to meme it out; all in the name of the One True <a href="https://heroeslounge.gg/user/view/29" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Petman</a>. The influx of many new captains and a new website, we thought that we'd share a short guide on how to schedule and report your matches in our brand new website.</p>
<hr class="seperataor">

<p><strong>Scheduling a match</strong></p>

<p>A match round begins Sunday midnight &nbsp;when all active teams will be given a opponent to play that round. Teams are given 7 days to schedule the match, and up to 14 days from Sunday midnight to play <em>(and report)</em> it. It is important to note that the responsibility of deciding when to play the matches falls on both captains. The common protocol is to DM your opposing captain through Discord (or BattleNet). Once a match is agreed by both parties, one of the captains can update the website.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>All captains should have access to this match overview page, with special ability to save a date. As you can see in the image above, matches have to be scheduled +7 days from assigned, and be played +14 days from assigned. All other dates are greyed out from selection.</p>

	<figcaption class="figure-caption">only valid dates are available for selection</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Click on the save date button and watch magic happen. There should be a green alert notifying you that the match is now officially scheduled and you can also view it from the calendar section. This is an important step as casters will be looking at this date to try and find games to cast <em>(nb: please do not ping casters on discord asking for your match to be cast. they are busy volunteers and there is a process)</em>. Ensure that the time entered for the match is in CET / CEST.</p>

</p>

<p>At times, there might be problems trying to schedule, contacting your opponents but captains must show reasonable attempts to contact each other. Should the captain on the opposing team fail to be responsive or neither team could find a reasonable resolution as to when the match should be played, do contact a moderator before the end of the 7th day <em>(ideally around the 6th day)</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Reporting a match</strong></p>

<p>Battle lines have been drawn, coins flipped, drafts rigged, games clowned; now it is time for the <u>winning captain of the series to upload the matches</u>. As per the rule set, please do remember to take screenshot of the draft. Several materials are required to report the result of the match - namely the replays (found in your heroes of the <span style="color: rgb(209, 213, 216);"><s><em>lounge</em></s></span> storm folder) and draft screenshots.</p>

<p>To add a game, click on the <strong><em>plus</em></strong> icon at the match view.</p>

	<figcaption class="figure-caption">reporting a game</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A pop up will appear with the 4 main fields to fill: the map played, the draft screenshot <em>(.jpg or .png)</em>, the game replay, <em>(.stormreplay)</em> and the winner of the match <em>(nb. failure to upload the correct replay and/or draft screenshot may result in</em><em>&nbsp;match being forfeited)</em>. Please do so in the correct game order, subsequent uploads will attempt to decide the winner of the series. The website, by default does not allow for draws therefore a wrong order of upload may result in a very hairy situation. Having said that, continue uploading in the correct order until all the games are reported.</p>

	<figcaption class="figure-caption">save the game the result should look like this</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Proceed to upload all your games until all games have been played.</p>

	<figcaption class="figure-caption">a draw, you shall not have</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When all the games are updated correctly, remember to click the <strong><em>"save match"</em></strong> icon. This action will inform the website to update scores and standings.</p>

<p>If you noticed, that there is a bin button beside each game in that series. Should a game be uploaded in error, click on the bin button to remove / redo the game. Division tables and rankings will be updated once the games are saved. These draft screenshots and replay files can later be retrieved by coach, allies and opponents alike for research and review purposes.</p>
